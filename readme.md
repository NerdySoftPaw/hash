## 💡 What is HASH?

**HASH** is not just a cleaning tracker; it's the central **Hub** for all your **Sweeping** and maintenance tasks within **Home Assistant**. 

Instead of just checking boxes, **HASH** uses your sensors (e.g., motion detectors, door contacts, or vacuum states) to determine when a room *actually* needs cleaning.

### Key Features
* 📊 **Smart Entities:** Every chore is a Home Assistant entity.
* 🤖 **Automation Ready:** Reset timers automatically when your Roborock finishes a zone.
* 📱 **iOS Style UI:** A clean, progress-based dashboard layout.
* ⏳ **Dynamic Prioritization:** Focus on what's dirty, not what's on the calendar.
